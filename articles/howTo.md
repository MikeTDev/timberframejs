# How To

## If you already know customElements

1. Assuming you are using some bundling technology like rollup, webpack, or vite. When you import the auObserver into app.js everything else is taken care of.
1. create a custom element and register it in the browser. Nothing tf- specific in this step.
1. Setup the auObserver to observe document.body or a root element in you application or component.
1. start with something a user would click on like a div or a button
1. add the tf- attributes to the element. 
1. add the name of the component to tf-post or tf-get for example tf-get="component name"
1. add the tf-target="css selector of the target" - where you want the component to appear on the dom
1. when the user clicks on your div

### Passing data to the custom element

Works similar to a good old fashioned forms example from 1995, but with a twist.
But instead of the FormData being sent to the server it is sent to the component.
The data will magically appear as model in your component. Or 'body' if you want the raw FormData.
BUT you need to esure 'model' or 'body' is defined on your component. If not nothing will be passed to it.
