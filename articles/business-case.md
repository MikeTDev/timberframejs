# Business Case

- Faster time for development.
- Easier to read than a pure javaScript component
- Fewer lines of code?
- Easier to unit test?



todo: create real world components and do a comparison


## Fewer Lines of code

I do believe components will be simpler, but need to be sure to include the attributes added to the trigger.
